# Executing PHP files




<div class="phpcode"><span class="html">
On Linux, the shebang (#!) line is parsed by the kernel into at most two parts. <br>For example:<br><br>1:&#xA0; #!/usr/bin/php<br>2:&#xA0; #!/usr/bin/env&#xA0; php<br>3:&#xA0; #!/usr/bin/php -n<br>4:&#xA0; #!/usr/bin/php -ddisplay_errors=E_ALL<br>5:&#xA0; #!/usr/bin/php -n -ddisplay_errors=E_ALL<br><br>1. is the standard way to start a script. (compare &quot;#!/bin/bash&quot;.)<br><br>2. uses &quot;env&quot; to find where PHP is installed: it might be elsewhere in the $PATH, such as /usr/local/bin.<br><br>3. if you don&apos;t need to use env, you can pass ONE parameter here. For example, to ignore the system&apos;s PHP.ini, and go with the defaults, use &quot;-n&quot;. (See &quot;man php&quot;.)<br><br>4.&#xA0; or, you can set exactly one configuration variable. I recommend this one, because display_errors actually takes effect if it is set here. Otherwise, the only place you can enable it is system-wide in php.ini. If you try to use ini_set() in your script itself, it&apos;s too late: if your script has a parse error, it will silently die. <br><br>5. This will not (as of 2013) work on Linux. It acts as if the whole string, &quot;-n -ddisplay_errors=E_ALL&quot; were a single argument. But in BSD, the shebang line can take more than 2 arguments, and so it may work as intended.<br><br>Summary: use (2) for maximum portability, and (4) for maximum debugging.</span>
