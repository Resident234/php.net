# Error Reporting




<div class="phpcode"><span class="html">
Note for those of you using OpenBSD and PHP.&#xA0; The default php.ini has display_errors=off . This is contrary to the PHP default of display_errors=on . If your having trouble seeing errors on OpenBSD make sure to edit your php.ini to have display_errors=on. (I had this problem on OpenBSD 4.4)</span>
