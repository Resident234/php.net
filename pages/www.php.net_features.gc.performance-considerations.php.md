# Performance Considerations



The GC, unfortunately, as expounded in the examples above, has the tendency to promote lazy programming.<br>Clearly the benefits of the GC to assist in memory management are there, and help to maintain a stable system, but it is no excuse to not plan and test your code properly.<br>Always re-read your code critically and objectively to ensure that you are not introducing memory leaks unintentionally.
