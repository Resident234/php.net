# ob_get_flush



Hi,<br>this is just to add a behavior that I haven&apos;t understud at first place.<br><br>ob_get_flush actually returns the content of the buffer as a text but also it sends the buffer back to the browser so that it&apos;s displayed on user screen.<br><br>Use ob_get_clean if you do not want the buffer to be send to the user
