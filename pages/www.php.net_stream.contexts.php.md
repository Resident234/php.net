# Stream Contexts



Two important terms: <br><br>- An *option* is a protocol-specific setting, e.g. "method" (get, post, put...) if you are using HTTP or "callback function to be called when inserting a document" in MongoDB.<br><br>- A *parameter* is a settings that&apos;s common to all protocols. As of 2015 only one parameter got implemented ("notification").<br><br>While these words might look vague they are used coherently throughout the stream feature, documentation included.
