# mysqli::debug



can there be more documenation with a small (but working) example script on how to use this ?<br><br>Some issues  (Ive seen the "same" code example in dozens of tutorials):-<br><br>( I&apos;ll use capitals for emphasis only)<br><br>QUESTION: what does D:T:O mean ? UNEXPLAINED.<br><br>QUESTION: Do we *ONLY* use these 3 lines in a self-contained script ? Does this log ALL future MYSQL commands ?<br><br>QUESTION :- Do we put that one line just<br><br>- immediately after we connect to MYSQL ?<br>- before we connect to MYSQL ?<br>- before our suspected error ?
