# usleep



WARNING!! <br><br>the snippet below by &apos;Marius (mm at co-operation dot de)&apos; is NOT a usleep and it will keep the CPU at 100% running. why people keep posting that crap is a complete mystery for me.<br><br>the idea of sleep and usleep is that by letting the cpu run a few idle cycles so the other programs can have some cycles run of their own. what results in better response times and lower overall system-load. so if you have to wait for something, go to sleep for a few seconds instead of occupying the cpu while doing absolute nothing but waitting.
