# iptcparse





Just to add to the above response, he missed a couple of IPTC tags:

Keywords:
$iptc[&quot;2#025&quot;][n];&#xA0;&#xA0; (there is a list of keywords)

Caption Writer:
$iptc[&quot;2#122&quot;][0];

Just figured I&apos;d note it, as the keywords can be quite important for database applications.&#xA0; I got these by extracting IPTC tags from a Photoshop 6.0 file, so hopefully they are standardized ;)
