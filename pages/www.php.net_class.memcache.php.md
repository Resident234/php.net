# The Memcache class



It helps to know that for this extension to work, you need a server with &apos;Memcached&apos; (a service independent of PHP) installed and running as a service.<br><br>The documentation herein refers a lot to &apos;memcache_host&apos;. This is not an arbitrary string, but should be a host name (eg localhost) or an IP address of a server running memcached.<br><br>If you have just installed the php memcache extension then you will not necessarily have memcached installed as well
