# gc_collect_cycles



(Since this function wasn&apos;t documented as of the date I left this note...)<br><br>If you came here looking for documentation, allow me to point you instead to a section in the user manual about garbage collection that includes a bit at the end about when you would use this feature and what it will actually do: http://php.net/manual/en/features.gc.collecting-cycles.php<br><br>Hope it helps!
