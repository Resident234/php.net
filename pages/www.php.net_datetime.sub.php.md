# DateTime::sub



Note that the sub() and add() methods will modify the value of the object you&apos;re calling the method on! This is very untypical for a method that returns a value of its own type. You could misunderstand it that the method would return a new instance with the modified value, but in fact it modifies itself! This is undocumented here. (Only a side note on procedural style mentions it, but it obviously does not apply to object oriented style.)
