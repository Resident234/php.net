  Function Overloading Feature
 





it&apos;s kinda evil and gives you tons of headache.

I took over a project with this &quot;feature&quot; enabled... took me a while to figure out why strings behaved non language standard. So, if you like to make grown men cry - by all means enable this deathtrap.

In short, only use mbstring.func_overload if you are 100% certain that nothing on your site relies on manipulating binary data in PHP.
