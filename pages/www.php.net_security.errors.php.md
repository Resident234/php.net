# Error Reporting



Note for those of you using OpenBSD and PHP.  The default php.ini has display_errors=off . This is contrary to the PHP default of display_errors=on . If your having trouble seeing errors on OpenBSD make sure to edit your php.ini to have display_errors=on. (I had this problem on OpenBSD 4.4)
