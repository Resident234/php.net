# New Features



It should be noted that typed properties internally are never initialized to a default null. Unless of course you initialize them to null yourself. That&apos;s why you will always going to encounter this error if you try to access them before initialization.<br><br>**Typed property foo::$bar must not be accessed before initialization**<br><br>

```
<?php
class User
{
    public $id;
    public string $name; // Typed property (Uninitialized)
    public ?string $age = null; //  Typed property (Initialized)
}

$user = new User;
var_dump(is_null($user->id)); // bool(true)
var_dump(is_null($user->name)); // PHP Fatal error: Typed property User::$name must not be accessed before initialization
var_dump(is_null($user->age));// bool(true)
?>
```
<br><br>Another thing worth noting is that it&apos;s not possible to initialize a property of type object to anything other than null.  Since the evaluation of properties happens at compile-time and object instantiation happens at runtime. One last thing, callable type is not supported due to its context-dependent behavior.
