# Microsoft SQL Server Functions (PDO_SQLSRV)





An updated driver compatible with both PHP 7.0 and Linux is available on the PHP-7.0-Linux branch of https://github.com/Microsoft/msphpsql/

This is more up to date and supports some additional features over the ODBC / DBLIB drivers.

It is currently considered an &apos;Early Technical Preview&apos; and hence has some limitations, but in my experience it has been stable.
