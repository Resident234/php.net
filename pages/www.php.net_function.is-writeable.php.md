# is_writeable




<div class="phpcode"><span class="html">
A tiny benefit of using is_writeable() instead of is_writable() is that is_writable() will pollute search results when searching source code for files containing the word &quot;table&quot;.<br><br>Writeable is an alternative and not as frequently used (but still absolutely correct) spelling of writable.</span>
