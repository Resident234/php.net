# Choosing an API





Apart from the feature list, I suggest you try out both MySQLi and PDO and find out what API design you like most. MySQLi is more powerful and probably more complex to learn. PDO is more elegant and has the advantage that you only need to learn one PHP API if you need to work with different DBMS in the future.
