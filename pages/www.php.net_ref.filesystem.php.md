# Filesystem Functions



I just learned that, to specify file names in a portable manner, you DON&apos;T need &apos;DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR&apos; - just use &apos;/&apos;. This really surprised and shocked me, as until now I typed about a zillion times &apos;DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR&apos; to stay platform independent - unnecessary. Don&apos;t make the same mistake.
