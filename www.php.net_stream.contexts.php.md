# Stream Contexts




<div class="phpcode"><span class="html">
Two important terms: <br><br>- An *option* is a protocol-specific setting, e.g. &quot;method&quot; (get, post, put...) if you are using HTTP or &quot;callback function to be called when inserting a document&quot; in MongoDB.<br><br>- A *parameter* is a settings that&apos;s common to all protocols. As of 2015 only one parameter got implemented (&quot;notification&quot;).<br><br>While these words might look vague they are used coherently throughout the stream feature, documentation included.</span>
