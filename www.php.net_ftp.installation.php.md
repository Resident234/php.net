For some reason folks downvoted the previous entry for this, BUT... indeed, as of PHP 7, to enable this on Windows you have to add the line:<br><br>extension=php_ftp.dll<br><br>to your php.ini to resolve PHP errors that tell you PHP FTP functions are not defined; the line isn&apos;t in there (where, many things are and are just commented out).</span>
