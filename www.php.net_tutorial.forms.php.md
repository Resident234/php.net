# Dealing with Forms




<div class="phpcode"><span class="html">
According to the HTTP specification, you should use the POST method when you&apos;re using the form to change the state of something on the server end. For example, if a page has a form to allow users to add their own comments, like this page here, the form should use POST. If you click &quot;Reload&quot; or &quot;Refresh&quot; on a page that you reached through a POST, it&apos;s almost always an error -- you shouldn&apos;t be posting the same comment twice -- which is why these pages aren&apos;t bookmarked or cached.<br><br>You should use the GET method when your form is, well, getting something off the server and not actually changing anything.&#xA0; For example, the form for a search engine should use GET, since searching a Web site should not be changing anything that the client might care about, and bookmarking or caching the results of a search-engine query is just as useful as bookmarking or caching a static HTML page.</span>

Also, don&apos;t ever use GET method in a form that capture passwords and other things that are meant to be hidden.</span>

<div class="phpcode"><span class="html">
worth clarifying: <br><br>POST is not more secure than GET. <br><br>The reasons for choosing GET vs POST involve various factors such as intent of the request (are you &quot;submitting&quot; information?), the size of the request (there are limits to how long a URL can be, and GET parameters are sent in the URL), and how easily you want the Action to be shareable -- Example, Google Searches are GET because it makes it easy to copy and share the search query with someone else simply by sharing the URL. <br><br>Security is only a consideration here due to the fact that a GET is easier to share than a POST. Example: you don&apos;t want a password to be sent by GET, because the user might share the resulting URL and inadvertently expose their password.<br><br>However, a GET and a POST are equally easy to intercept by a well-placed malicious person if you don&apos;t deploy TLS/SSL to protect the network connection itself. <br><br>All Forms sent over HTTP (usually port 80) are insecure, and today (2017), there aren&apos;t many good reasons for a public website to not be using HTTPS (which is basically HTTP + Transport Layer Security). <br><br>As a bonus, if you use TLS&#xA0; you minimise the risk of your users getting code (ADs) injected into your traffic that wasn&apos;t put there by you.</span>
