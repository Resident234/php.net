Deleted a large file but seeing no increase in free space or decrease of disk usage? Using UNIX or other POSIX OS?<br><br>The unlink() is not about removing file, it&apos;s about removing a file name. The manpage says: ``unlink - delete a name and possibly the file it refers to&apos;&apos;.<br><br>Most of the time a file has just one name -- removing it will also remove (free, deallocate) the `body&apos; of file (with one caveat, see below). That&apos;s the simple, usual case.<br><br>However, it&apos;s perfectly fine for a file to have several names (see the link() function), in the same or different directories. All the names will refer to the file body and `keep it alive&apos;, so to say. Only when all the names are removed, the body of file actually is freed.<br><br>The caveat:<br>A file&apos;s body may *also* be `kept alive&apos; (still using diskspace) by a process holding the file open. The body will not be deallocated (will not free disk space) as long as the process holds it open. In fact, there&apos;s a fancy way of resurrecting a file removed by a mistake but still held open by a process...</span>

To anyone who&apos;s had a problem with the permissions denied error, it&apos;s sometimes caused when you try to delete a file that&apos;s in a folder higher in the hierarchy to your working directory (i.e. when trying to delete a path that starts with &quot;../&quot;).<br><br>So to work around this problem, you can use chdir() to change the working directory to the folder where the file you want to unlink is located.<br><br><span class="default">&lt;?php<br>&#xA0; &#xA0; $old </span><span class="keyword">= </span><span class="default">getcwd</span><span class="keyword">(); </span><span class="comment">// Save the current directory<br>&#xA0; &#xA0; </span><span class="default">chdir</span><span class="keyword">(</span><span class="default">$path_to_file</span><span class="keyword">);<br>&#xA0; &#xA0; </span><span class="default">unlink</span><span class="keyword">(</span><span class="default">$filename</span><span class="keyword">);<br>&#xA0; &#xA0; </span><span class="default">chdir</span><span class="keyword">(</span><span class="default">$old</span><span class="keyword">); </span><span class="comment">// Restore the old working directory&#xA0; &#xA0; <br></span><span class="default">?&gt;</span>
