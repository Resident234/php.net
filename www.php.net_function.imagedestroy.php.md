<div class="phpcode"><span class="html">
Caution should be observed with imagedestroy(); copying your reference variable over to another variable will cause imagedestroy to destroy both at once.<br><br>Eg.: <br><br>$a = imagecreate(...);<br>$b = $a;<br>imagedestroy($a);<br><br>While you&apos;d think $b still contains your image, it doesn&apos;t. Both $a and $b are destroyed.</span>
